The sentences should be the same length for dataloader using. And I have to make some changes in model for load date by batches.\n",
        "2. **To make some changes in baseline model.** I join encoder and decoder with attention to single model. To do this I make encoder forward to work with whole batch, not with only one word like in baseline model. Decoder forward I keep unchanged, except that I pass for one word from whole batch, so that decoder works with tensor size equal to batch size. Padding the sentences can make model work worser, to I add mask to attention and use *pad_packed_sequence* in encoder to nevilate padding. I change Attention to work with encoder output, not with decoder imput like in baseline model.\n",
